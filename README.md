PROTOTYPE README

HOW TO RUN THE PROTOTYPE

run our node server called "server.js" in our back-end folder in this project

by directing yourself to that directory and running "node server.js"


WHAT IS WOWRKING IN OUR PROTOTYPE

1) Registration of a Team/Player:
After running the server, open: "http://localhost:8080/login"
On this page you will see a register button on right hand side, click on that button.

For the Email Field: enter a valid email 

Then fill out the necessary fields and click on "Register Account", this WILL create an account on our backend and will send you 
a verification email to the you signed up with.

2) Adding Games
Open "http://localhost:8080/gamepage"

This pages shows you, the coach, all of your teams games. 

We've also added funtionality to add a game to the list, and synchronize it with our backend. 

So, navigate to add Game,

enter the fields, and click add game, this wil lad the game to hte server, and if you close the popup and refresh the page, you will see the new game!

3) View Past Analytics on Home Page, and view/edit categories


Open "http://localhost:8080/home" and play aroudn with it!! :)

You can play with "view and edit categories"

4) View Players on Your team

Open "http://localhost:8080/players"

Playes show up and can be added to the database, but will unfortunately not show the changes o nthe screen(we are workign on that ! :)

5) Play with the nav bar on the left!!


Notes: 

We are still finalizing login because we must make a distinctio nbetween coaches and players. But we will have this up and running shortly.
